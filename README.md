#ABSTRACT
With the growing population and recurrent changes in climate and environment, there has also been  continuous growth in the number of informal settlements in the country. These settlers are the most vulnerable when it comes to disasters because of the quality of housing materials they used. Thus, it would help to develop a tool to automatically classify between settlement types which can be used by decision makers to address specific concerns such as disaster risk management, urban planning, and monitoring the population of informal settler families. This study uses satellite images from Google Earth, which are then pre-processed for further analysis. Texture feature using Multi-scale Block Local Binary Pattern (MB-LBP) operator is computed from the pre-processed images and the cosine similarity function is applied in order to classify whether a particular area is informal or formal settlement. Results show that using a 15x15 MB-LBP operator gives the optimal values for precision (97.18\%) and accuracy (95.00\%) which therefore suggests that the use of MB-LBP operator for texture analysis is a promising method for settlement classification.
